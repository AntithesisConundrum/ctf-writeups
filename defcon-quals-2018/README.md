# CTF: DEFCON Quals
Writeups I wrote for the 2018 DEFCON quals, hosted by OOOverflow.
Points for each problem were dynamically scored: problems solved by
one team were worth 500 points, points that were solved by two teams
were worth 460 points, and so on asymptotically down to 100.

Interestingly, because the "human interaction" sanity-check was released
40 hours into the competition, it ended up being worth more than two
legitimate, easy challenges.

I participated as part of RiceSec, where we placed 61st out of 586 scoring
teams with a score of 746. We solved:
* YouAlreadyKnow
* Fragments
* EasyPisy
* Sbva
* Eval-wl
* Mom
* Throwback
